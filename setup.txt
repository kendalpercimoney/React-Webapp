docker pull node:20-alpine

Used docker and plan on using it in the future with node js

Installed using msi file, had to restart before it showed up in terminal

npx create-react-app react-webapp --use-npm was supposed to do the trick, but threw error code enoent

Success! Created react-webapp at C:\Users\HP\Documents\GitHub\react-webapp      
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-webapp
  npm start

Happy hacking!
